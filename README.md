##  ```Warning``` : the interpreter is nowhere near ready to be used, many bugs currently exist, as it's very early into development.


### Using the Interpreter

1. Create a file in ```src/tests``` with an extension name of ```mspl```.
2. Head into ```src/MSPL.py``` and change the ```TestCase``` variable to your mspl file's name.
3. Run MSPL eg. ```python src/MSPL.py```

   print("Hello World!");
   
   let LanguageName = "MSPL";
